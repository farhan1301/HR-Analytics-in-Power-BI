## Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of Human Resources data from a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. Using Power BI and DAX, the project focuses on uncovering insights related to employee attrition, hiring trends, and performance metrics. The analysis was conducted on a dataset comprising information on approximately 1,470 employees.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Loading and Preparation**
- **Data Modeling**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **DAX Calculations**
- **Data Visualization**

## Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: 
  - Dashboards analyzing employee attrition, hiring trends, and performance metrics.
  - Visualizations include bar charts, treemaps, and line graphs to represent various HR metrics.
  
- **DAX-Powered Analysis**:
  - Use of DAX functions to calculate key HR metrics like the percentage of employee attrition, active/inactive employee counts, and more.
  - Custom measures created for dynamic and meaningful data insights.

- **Comprehensive Data Model**:
  - Data tables connected using both active and inactive relationships to allow for robust data analysis.
  - Integration of multiple data sources into a cohesive model for detailed analysis.
